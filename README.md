# Extract_BioClim
Extracts BioClim climate data for regions or specific locations across the globe.
This code allows you to extract data for all 19 variables and to plot each variable on a map.
Data source: http://www.worldclim.org/bioclim

I forked and adapted this code from [cacurtis](https://github.com/cacurtis/create_bioclim), much thanks!

This version specifically creates the Bioclim set from PRISM data. The file formatting should line up with what is available from the [PRISM site](http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu).
